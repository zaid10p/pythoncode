# Implementation of binary search algorithm!!
# We will prove that binary search is faster than naive search!


# Essence of binary search:
# If you have a sorted list and you want to search this array for something,
# You could go through each item in the list and ask, is this equal to what we're looking for?
# But we can make this *faster* by leveraging the fact that our array is sorted!
# Binary search ~ O(log(n)), naive search ~ O(n)

# binary search uses divide and conquer!
# we will leverage the fact that our list is SORTED
def binary_search(l, target, low=None, high=None):
    if low is None:
        low = 0
    if high is None:
        high = len(l) - 1

    if high < low:
        return -1

    # example l = [1, 3, 5, 10, 12]  # should return 3
    midpoint = (low + high) // 2  # 2

    # we'll check if l[midpoint] == target, and if not, we can find out if
    # target will be to the left or right of midpoint
    # we know everything to the left of midpoint is smaller than the midpoint
    # and everything to the right is larger
    if l[midpoint] == target:
        return midpoint
    elif target < l[midpoint]:
        return binary_search(l, target, low, midpoint-1)
    else:
        # target > l[midpoint]
        return binary_search(l, target, midpoint+1, high)
